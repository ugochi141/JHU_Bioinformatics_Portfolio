# Assignment 9: File I/O and BioPython Operations

## Course: AS.410.634.81 - Practical Computer Concepts for Bioinformatics
**Instructor**: Dr. Nadim Alkharouf  
**Institution**: Johns Hopkins University

## Overview
This assignment focuses on file input/output operations and basic BioPython-style sequence processing, essential skills for bioinformatics data handling.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: File Creation (`NumberList.txt`)
- Creates a text file containing numbers 1-100
- Demonstrates file writing operations
- Sets up data for subsequent processing

### Task 2: File Reading and Processing
- Reads numerical data from files
- Performs mathematical operations (summation)
- Displays both individual values and calculated results

### Task 3: Sequence File Processing
- Processes multiple sequence files (`seq1.txt`, `seq2.txt`)
- Combines sequence data with delimiters
- Creates consolidated output files
- Simulates basic FASTA-style processing

## Key Features

### File Operations
- **Write Operations**: Creating numbered lists
- **Read Operations**: Processing line-by-line data
- **File Discovery**: Automatically finding sequence files
- **Output Generation**: Creating processed result files

### Bioinformatics Applications
- **Sequence Handling**: Processing biological sequence data
- **Data Integration**: Combining multiple sequence files
- **Format Processing**: Working with text-based biological data formats

## Files Included
- `assignment9.py` - Main assignment implementation
- `sequence_reader.py` - Additional sequence processing utilities
- `NumberList.txt` - Generated numerical data file
- `seq1.txt` - Sample sequence file 1
- `seq2.txt` - Sample sequence file 2
- `combined_sequences.txt` - Processed sequence output
- `Output.txt` - Final processed output file

## Learning Outcomes
- File I/O operations in Python
- Processing biological sequence data
- Automated file discovery and processing
- Data consolidation techniques
- Basic bioinformatics file handling patterns

## How to Run
```bash
# Run the main assignment
python3 assignment9.py

# Run additional sequence processing
python3 sequence_reader.py
```

## Expected Output
1. Creates `NumberList.txt` with numbers 1-100
2. Displays numbers and their sum (5050)
3. Processes sequence files and creates combined output
4. Generates consolidated results in `Output.txt`

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
