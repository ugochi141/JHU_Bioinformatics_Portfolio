# Assignment 6: Control Structures and Lists

## Course: AS.410.634.81 - Practical Computer Concepts for Bioinformatics
**Instructor**: Dr. Nadim Alkharouf  
**Institution**: Johns Hopkins University

## Overview
This assignment focuses on Python control structures (if-elif-else, while loops, for loops) and list operations in the context of bioinformatics applications.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Weight Calculator
- Implements if-elif-else conditional statements
- Calculates weight using physics formula (Weight = mass Ã— 9.8)
- Provides feedback based on weight thresholds

### Task 2: Input Validation
- Uses while loop for input validation
- Ensures user enters numbers within specified range (1-100)
- Demonstrates proper user input handling

### Task 3: Bug Collector Loop
- Implements for loop for data collection
- Simulates collecting bugs over 7 days
- Calculates and displays total collection

### Task 4: Amino Acids List Creation
- Creates and manipulates lists of biological data
- Demonstrates list printing methods
- Shows iteration over biological sequences

### Task 5: List Manipulation Functions
- append(), sort(), reverse() operations
- List slicing for subsequences
- Practical applications with amino acid data

### Task 6: User-Driven List Selection
- Combines lists with conditional logic
- Validates user input against list bounds
- Provides interactive selection of amino acids

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Control flow in Python programming
- List operations for biological data
- Input validation and error handling
- Interactive program design
- Application of programming concepts to bioinformatics

## Files
- `Ndubuisi_A06.py` - Complete assignment implementation

## How to Run
```bash
python3 Ndubuisi_A06.py
```

## Sample Output
The program demonstrates interactive weight calculation, number validation, data collection simulation, and amino acid list manipulation with user feedback for each operation.
